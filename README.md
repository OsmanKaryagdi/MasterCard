# MasterCard

I used one of the stories that Iâ€™ve written once. I assigned the story to a string and named it str.

I have split the string with white space and I stored the result in an array. Then I looped through all the elements inside the arrays to compare the length. In order to do that I initialized a counter and used it to store the longest character number. And I also initialized an empty string to store the longest string value. And I returned the value.
